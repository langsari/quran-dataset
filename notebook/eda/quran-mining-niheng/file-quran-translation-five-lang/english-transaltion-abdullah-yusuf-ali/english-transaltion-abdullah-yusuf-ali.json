them although from of old they had prayed for victory against those without faith when there comes to them that which they  should  have recognized they refused to believe in it  but the curse of God is on those without Faith ","96":"   Miserable is the price for which they have sold their souls in that they deny  the revelation  which God has sent down in insolent envy that God of His Grace

prophets of God in times gone by if ye did indeed believe  ","98":"   There came to you Moses with clear  Signs   yet ye worshipped the Calf  even  after that and ye did behave wrongfully ","99":"   And remember We took your Covenant and We raised above you  the towering height  of Mount  Sinai   saying    Hold firmly to what We have given you and hearken  to the Law    they said   We hear and we disobey   and they had to drink into their hearts  of the taint  of the calf because of their faithlessness  Say   Vile indeed are the behests of your faith if ye have any faith  ","100":"   Say   If the last Home with God be for you specially and not for anyone else then seek ye for death if ye are sincere  ","101":"   But they will never seek for death on account of the  sins  which their hands have sent on before them  And God is well acquainted with the wrong doers ","102":"   Thou wilt indeed find them of all people most greedy of life even more than the idolaters  each one of them wishes

confirming what was with them a party of the people of the Book threw away the Book of God behind their backs as if  it had been something  they did not know ","108":"   They followed what the evil ones gave out  falsely  against the power of Solomon  the blasphemers were not Solomon but the evil ones teaching men magic and such things as came down at Babylon to the angels Harut and Marut  But neither of these taught anyone  such things  without saying   We are only for trial so do not blaspheme   They learned from them the means to sow discord between man and wife  But they could not thus harm anyone except by God s permission  And they learned what harmed them not what profited them  And they knew that the buyers of  magic  would have no share in the happiness of the Hereafter  And vile was the price for which they did sell their souls if they but knew ","109":"   If they had kept their faith and guarded themselves from evil far better had been the reward from their Lord if they but knew    ","110":"   O ye of Faith  say not  to the Apostle  words of ambiguous import but words of respect  and hearken  to him   to those without faith is a grievous punishment ","111":"   It is never the wish of those without faith among the people of the Book nor of the Pagans that anything good should come down to you from your Lord  But God will choose for His special Mercy whom He will for God is Lord of grace abounding ","112":"   None of Our revelations do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten but We substitute something better or similar  knowest thou not that God hath power over all things ","113":"   Knowest thou not that to God belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth  And besides Him ye have neither patron nor helper ","114":"   Would ye question your Apostle as Moses was questioned of old  But whoever changeth from faith to unbelief hath strayed without doubt from the even way ","115":"   Quite a number of the people of the Book wish they could turn you  people  back to infidelity after ye have believed from selfish envy after the truth hath become manifest unto them  but forgive and overlook till God accomplish His purpose  for God hath power over all things ","116":"   And be steadfast in prayer and regular in charity  and whatever good ye send forth for your souls before you ye shall find it with God  for God sees well all that ye do

his whole self to God and is a doer of good he will get his reward with his Lord  on such shall be no fear nor shall they grieve    ","119":"   The Jews say   The Christians have naught  to stand  upon   and the Christians say   The Jews have naught  to stand  upon   Yet they  profess to  study the  same  Book  Like unto their word is what those say who know not but God will judge between them in their quarrel on the Day of Judgment ","120":"   And who is more unjust than he who forbids that in places for the worship of God God s name should be celebrated  Whose zeal is  in fact  to ruin them  It was not fitting that such should themselves enter them except in fear  For them there is nothing but disgrace in this world and in the world to come an exceeding torment ","121":"   To God belong the East and the West  whithersoever ye turn there is the presence of God  For God is All Pervading All Knowing ","122":"   They say   God hath begotten a son   Glory be to Him  Nay to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth  everything renders worship to Him ","123":"   To Him is due the primal origin of the heavens and the earth  when He decreeth a matter He saith to it   Be   and it is ","124":"   Say those without knowledge   Why speaketh not God unto Us  Or why cometh not unto Us a sign   So said the people before them words of similar import  Their hearts are alike

question shall be asked of Companions of the blazing fire ","126":"   Never will the Jews or the Christians be satisfied with thee unless thou follow their form of religion  Say   The guidance of God that is the  only  guidance   Wert thou to follow their desires after the knowledge which hath reached thee then wouldst thou find neither protector nor helper against God ","127":"   Those to whom We have sent the book study it as it should be studied  they are the ones that believe therein  those who reject faith therein the loss is their own    ","128":"   O Children of Israel  call to mind the special favor which I bestowed upon you and that I preferred you to all others  for my message  ","129":"   Then guard yourselves against a day when one soul shall not avail another nor shall

He forgave you  for God is full of grace to those who believe ","445":"   Behold  ye were climbing up the high ground without even casting a side glance at anyone and the Apostle in your rear was calling you back  There did God give you one distress after another by way of requital to teach you not to grieve for  the booty  that had escaped you and for  the ill  that had befallen you  For God

not reveal to thee  They say  to themselves    If we had anything to do with this affair we should not have been in the slaughter here   Say   Even if you had remained in your homes those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death   but  all this was  that God might test what is in your breasts and purge what is in your hearts  for God knoweth well

fighting   If they had stayed with us they would not have died or been slain  This that God may make it a cause of sighs and regrets in their hearts  It is God that gives life and death and God sees well all that ye do ","449":"   And if ye are slain or die in the way of God forgiveness and mercy from God are far better than all they could amass ","450":"   And if ye die or are slain Lo  it is unto God that ye are brought together ","451":"   It is part of the Mercy of God that thou dost deal gently with them  Wert thou severe or harsh hearted they would have broken away from about thee  so

his votaries  be ye not afraid of them but fear Me if ye have faith ","468":"   Let not those grieve thee who rush headlong into unbelief  not the least harm will they do to God  God s plan is that He will give them no portion in the Hereafter but a severe punishment ","469":"   Those who purchase unbelief at the price of faith not the least harm will they do to God but they will have a grievous punishment ","470":"   Let not the Unbelievers think that our respite to them is good for themselves  We grant them respite that they may grow in their iniquity  but they will have a shameful punishment ","471":"   Allah will not leave the believers in the state in which ye are now until He separates what is evil from what is good  Nor will He disclose to you the secrets of the Unseen  But

captive  that your right hands possess  That will be more suitable to prevent you from doing injustice ","496":"   And give the women  on marriage  their dower as a free gift  but if they of their own good pleasure remit any part of it to you take it and enjoy it with right good cheer ","497":"   To those weak of understanding make not over your property which God hath made a means of support for you but feed and clothe them therewith and speak to them words of kindness and justice ","498":"   Make trial of orphans until they reach the age of marriage  if then ye find sound judgment in them

guidance and an admonition to those who fear God ","715":"   Let the people of the Gospel Judge by what God hath revealed therein  If any do fail to judge by  the light of  what God hath revealed they are  no better than  those who rebel ","716":"   To thee We sent the Scripture in truth confirming the scripture that came before it and guarding it in safety  so judge between them by what God hath revealed and follow not their vain desires diverging from the truth that hath come to thee  To each among you have We prescribed a Law and an Open Way  If God had so willed He would have made you a

in God and the revelation that hath come to us and that which came before  us  and  perhaps  that most of you are rebellious and disobedient  ","728":"   Say   Shall I point out to you something much worse than this  as judged  by the treatment it received from God  Those who incurred the curse of God and His wrath those of whom some He transformed into apes and swine those who worshipped Evil

show our gratitude    ","852":"   Say   It is God that delivereth you from these and all  other  distresses  and yet ye worship false gods  ","853":"   Say   He hath power to send calamities on you from above and below or to cover you with confusion in party strife giving you a taste of mutual vengeance each from the other   See how We explain the Signs by various  symbols  that they may understand ","854":"   But thy people reject this though it is the truth  Say   Not mine is the responsibility for arranging your affairs ","855":"    For every Message is a limit of time and soon shall ye know it  ","856":"   When thou seest men engaged in vain discourse about Our Signs turn away from them unless they turn to a different theme  If Satan ever makes thee forget then after recol  sit not thou in the company of the ungodly ","857":"   On their account no responsibility falls on the righteous but  their duty  is to remind them that they may  learn to  fear God ","858":"   Leave alone those who take their religion to be mere play and amusement and are deceived by the life of this world  But proclaim  to them  this  truth   that every soul delivers itself to ruin by its own acts  it will find for itself no protector or intercessor except God  if it offered every ransom  or reparation  none will be accepted  such is  the end of  those who deliver themselves to ruin by their own acts  they will have for drink  only  boiling water and for punishment one most grievous  for they persisted in rejecting God    ","859":"   Say   Shall we indeed call on others besides God things that can do us neither good nor harm and turn on our heels after receiving guidance from God  Like one whom the evil ones have made into a fool wandering bewildered through the earth his friends calling  Come to us   vainly  guiding him to the Path   Say   God s guidance is the  only  guidance and we have been directed to submit ourselves to the Lord of the worlds ","860":"    To

partners to God ","867":"    For me I have set my face firmly and truly toward Him Who created the heavens and the earth  and never shall I give partners to God  ","868":"   His people disputed with him  He said    come  ye to dispute with me about God when He  Himself  hath guided me  I fear not  the beings  ye associate with God  unless my Lord willeth  nothing can happen   My Lord comprehendeth in His knowledge all things  will ye not  yourselves  be admonished  ","869":"    How should I fear  the beings  ye associate with God when ye fear not to give partners to God without any warrant having been given to you  Which of  us  two parties hath more right to security   tell me  if ye know ","870":"    It is those who believe and confuse not their beliefs with wrong that are  truly  in security for they are on  right  guidance     ","871":"   That was the reasoning about Us which We gave to Abraham  to use  against his people  We raise whom We will degree after degree  for thy Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge ","872":"   We gave him Isaac and Jacob  all  three  We guided  and before him  We guided Noah  and among his progeny  David  Solomon  Job  Joseph  Moses

and authority and prophethood  if these  their descendants  reject them behold  We shall entrust their charge to a new People who reject them not ","878":"   Those were the  prophets  who received God s guidance  copy the guidance they received  Say   No reward for this do I ask of you  this is no less than a Message for the nations     ","879":"   No just estimate of God do they make when they say   Nothing doth God send down to man  by way of revelation    Say   Who then sent down the Book which Moses brought  a light and guidance to man  but ye make it into  separate  sheets for show while ye conceal much  of its contents   therein were ye taught that which ye knew not neither ye nor your fathers   Say   God  sent it down    then leave them to plunge in vain discourse and trifling ","880":"   And this is a Book which We have revealed bringing blessings and confirming  the revelations  which came before it  that thou mayest warn the Mother of Cities and all around her  Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in this  Book  and they are constant in guarding their prayers ","881":"   Who can be more wicked than one who inventeth a lie against God or saith  I have received

angels stretch forth their hands  saying   Yield up your souls  This day shall ye receive your reward a penalty of shame for that ye used to tell lies against God and scornfully to reject of His Signs  ","882":"    And behold  ye come to Us bare and alone as We created you for the first time  Ye have left behind you all  the favors  which We bestowed on you  We see not with you your intercessors whom ye thought to be partners in your affairs  so now all relations between you have been cut off and your  pet  fancies have left you in the lurch     ","883":"   It is God Who causeth the seed grain and the date stone to split and sprout  He causeth the living to issue from the dead and He is the one to cause the dead to issue from the living  That is God  then how are ye deluded away from the truth ","884":"   He it is that cleaveth the daybreak  from the dark   He makes the night for rest and tranquillity and the sun and moon for the reckoning  of time   such is the judgment and

sea  We detail Our Signs for people who know ","886":"   It is He who hath produced you from a single person  here is a place of sojourn and a place of departure  We detail Our signs for people who understand ","887":"   It is He who sendeth down rain from the skies  with it We produce vegetation of all kinds  from some We produce green  crops  out of which We produce grain heaped up  at harvest

different  in variety   when they begin to bear fruit and the ripeness thereof  Behold  in these things there are signs for people who believe ","888":"   Yet they make the Jinns equals with God though God did create the Jinns  and they falsely having no knowledge attribute to Him sons and daughters  Praise and glory be to Him   for He is  above what they attribute to Him     ","889":"   To Him is due the primal origin of the heavens and the earth  how can He have a son when He hath no consort  He created all things and He hath full knowledge of all things ","890":"   That is God your

will be blind it will be to his own  harm   I am not  here  to watch over your doings  ","893":"   Thus do We explain the Signs by various  symbols   that they may say  Thou hast taught us diligently  and that We may make the matter clear to those who know ","894":"   Follow what thou art taught by inspiration from thy Lord  there is no god but He  and turn aside from those who join gods with God

Revile not ye those whom they call upon besides God lest they out of spite revile God in their ignorance  Thus have We made alluring to each people its own doings  In the end will they return to their Lord and We shall then tell them the truth of all that they did ","897":"   They swear their strongest oaths by God that if a  special  sign came to them by it they would believe  Say   Certainly  all

their eyes even as they refused to believe in the first instance  We shall leave them in their trespasses to wander in distraction    ","899":"   Even if We did send unto them angels and the dead did speak unto them and We gathered together all things before their very eyes they are not the ones to believe unless it is in God s Plan  but most of them ignore  the truth  ","900":"   Likewise did We make for every Messenger an enemy evil ones among men and Jinns inspiring each other with flowery discourses by way of deception  If thy Lord had so planned they would not have done it  so leave them and their inventions alone ","901":"   To such  deceit  let the hearts of those incline who have no faith in the Hereafter  let them delight in it and let them earn from it what they may ","902":"

Lord in truth  Never be then of those who doubt ","903":"   The Word of thy Lord doth find its fulfillment in truth and in justice  none can change His Words  for He is the one who heareth and knoweth all ","904":"   Wert thou to follow the common run of those on earth they will lead thee away from the Way of God  They follow nothing but conjecture  they do nothing but lie ","905":"   Thy Lord

mislead  men  by their appetites unchecked by knowledge  Thy Lord knoweth best those who transgress ","908":"   Eschew all sin open or secret  those who earn sin will get due recompense for their  earnings  ","909":"   Eat not of  meats  on which God s name hath not been pronounced  that would be impiety  But the evil ones ever inspire their friends to contend with you  if ye were to obey them ye would indeed be pagans    ","910":"   Can he who was dead to whom We gave life and a Light whereby he can walk amongst men be like him who is in the depths of darkness from which he can never come out  Thus to those without faith their own deeds seem pleasing ","911":"   Thus have We placed leaders in every town its wicked men to plot  and burrow  therein  but they only plot against their own souls and they perceive it not ","912":"   When there comes to them a Sign  from God  they say   We shall not believe until we receive one  exactly  like those received by God s apostles   God knoweth best where  and how  to carry out His mission  Soon will the wicked be overtaken by humiliation before God and a severe punishment for all their plots ","913":"   Those whom God  in His Plan  willeth to guide He openeth their breast to Islam  those whom He willeth to leave straying He maketh their breast close and constricted as if they had to climb up to the skies  thus doth God  heap  the penalty on those who refuse to believe ","914":"   This is the way of thy Lord leading straight  We have detailed the Signs for those who receive admonition ","915":"   For them will be a Home of

dwelling place you will dwell therein for ever except as God willeth   For thy Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge ","917":"   Thus do We make the wrong doers turn to each other because of what they earn    ","918":"   O ye assembly of Jinns and men  came there not unto you apostles from amongst you setting forth unto you of the meeting of this day of yours   They will say   We bear witness against ourselves   It was the life of this world that deceived them  So against themselves will they bear witness that they rejected faith ","919":"    The apostles were sent  thus for thy Lord would not destroy for their wrong doing men s habitations whilst their occupants were unwarned ","920":"   To all are degrees  or ranks  according to their deeds  for thy Lord is not unmindful of anything that they do ","921":"   Thy Lord is Self sufficient full of Mercy  if it were His Will He could destroy you and in your place appoint whom He will as your successors even as he raised you up from the posterity of other people ","922":"   All that hath been promised unto you will come to pass  nor can ye frustrate it  in the least bit  ","923":"   Say   O my people  do whatever ye can  I will do  my part   soon will ye know who it is whose end will be  best  in the Hereafter  certain it is that the wrong doers will not prosper  ","924":"   Out of what God hath produced in abundance in tilth and in cattle they assigned Him a share  they say according to their fancies   This is for God and this for our  partners'   But the share of their  partners  reacheth not God whilst the share of God reacheth their  partners   Evil  and unjust  is their assignment  ","925":"   Even so in the eyes of most of the Pagans their  partners  made alluring the slaughter of their children in order to lead them to their own destruction and cause confusion in their religion  If God had willed they would not have done so  but leave alone them and their inventions ","926":"   And they say that such and such cattle and crops are taboo and none should eat of them except those whom so they say We wish  further there are cattle forbidden to yoke or burden and cattle on which  at slaughter  the name of God is not pronounced  inventions against God s name  soon will He requite them for their inventions ","927":"   They say   What is in the wombs of such and such cattle is specially reserved  for food  for our men and forbidden to our women  but if it is still born then all have shares therein  For their  false  attribution  of superstitions to God   He will soon punish them  for He is full of Wisdom and Knowledge ","928":"   Lost are those who slay their children from folly without knowledge and forbid food which God hath provided for them inventing  lies  against God  They have indeed gone astray and heeded no guidance    ","929":"   It is He who produceth gardens with trellises and without and dates and tilth with produce of all kinds and olives and pomegranates similar  in kind

knowledge if ye are truthful ","932":"   Of camels a pair and of oxen a pair  say hath He forbidden the two males or the two females or the  the young  which the wombs of the two females enclose  Were ye present when God ordered you such a thing  But who doth more wrong than one who invents a lie against God to lead astray men without knowledge  For God guideth not people who do wrong    ","933":"   Say   I find not in the Message received by me by inspiration any  meat  forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it unless it be dead meat or blood poured forth or the flesh of swine for it is an abomination or what is impious  meat  on which a name has been invoked other than God s   But  even so  if a person is forced by necessity without wilful disobedience nor transgressing due limits thy Lord is Oft Forgiving Most Merciful ","934":"   For those who followed the Jewish Law We forbade every  animal  with undivided hoof and We forbade them the fat of the ox and the sheep except what adheres to their backs or their entrails or is mixed up with a bone  this in recompense for their wilful disobedience  for We are True  in Our ordinances  ","935":"   If they accuse thee of falsehood

given partners to Him nor would our father  nor should we have had any taboos   So did their ancestors argue falsely until they tasted of Our wrath  Say   Have ye any  certain  Knowledge  If so produce it before us  Ye follow nothing but conjecture  Ye do nothing but lie  ","937":"   Say   With God is the argument that reaches home  if it had been his will he could indeed have guided you all  ","938":"   Say   Bring forward your witnesses to prove that God did forbid so and so   If they bring such witnesses be not thou amongst them  nor follow thou the vain desires of such as treat Our Signs as falsehoods and such as believe not in the Hereafter  for they hold others as equal with their Guardian Lord    ","939":"   Say   Come I will rehearse what God hath  really  prohibited you

will scatter you about from His  great  path  thus doth He command you that ye may be righteous ","942":"   Moreover We gave Moses the Book completing  Our favor  to those who would do right and explaining all things in detail and a guide and a mercy that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord    ","943":"   And this is a Book which We have revealed as a blessing  so follow it and be righteous that ye may receive mercy ","944":"   Lest ye should say   The Book was sent down to two peoples before us and for our part we remained unacquainted with all that they learned by assiduous study  ","945":"   Or lest ye should say   If the Book had only been sent down to us we should have followed its guidance better than they   Now then hath come unto you a Clear  sign  from your Lord and a guide and a mercy  then who could do more wrong than one who rejecteth God s signs and turneth away therefrom  In good time shall We requite those who turn away from Our Signs with a dreadful penalty for their turning away ","946":"   Are they waiting to see if the angels come to them or thy Lord  Himself  or certain of the signs of thy Lord  the day that certain of the signs of thy Lord do come no good will it do to a soul to believe in them then if it believed not before nor earned righteousness through its Faith  Say   Wait ye  we too are waiting  ","947":"   As for those who divide their religion and break up into sects thou hast no part in them in the least  their affair is with God  He will in the end tell them the truth of all that they did ","948":"   He that doeth good shall have ten times as much to his credit  he that doeth evil shall only be recompensed according to his evil  No wrong shall be done unto  any of  them ","949":"   Say   Verily my Lord hath guided me to a way that is straight a religion of right the path  trod  by Abraham the true in faith and he  certainly  joined not gods with God  ","950":"   Say   Truly my prayer and my service

their souls in perdition for that they wrongfully treated our signs ","963":"   It is We who have placed you with authority on earth and provided you therein with means for the fulfillment of your life  small are the thanks that ye give    ","964":"   It is We who created you and gave you shape  then We bade the angels bow down to Adam and they bowed down  not so Iblis  he refused to be of

brought about their fall  when they tasted of the tree their shame became manifest to them and they began to sew together the leaves of the garden over their bodies  And their Lord called unto them

be an adornment to you but the raiment of righteousness that is the best  Such are among the signs of God that they may receive admonition ","980":"   O ye children of Adam  let not satan seduce you in the same manner as he got your parents out of the garden stripping them of their raiment to expose their shame  for he and his tribe watch you from a position where ye cannot see them  We made the evil ones friends  only  to those without faith ","981":"   When they do aught that is shameful they say   We found our fathers doing so   and  God commanded us thus   say   Nay God never commands

signs in detail for those who understand ","986":"   Say  The things that my Lord hath indeed forbidden are  shameful deeds whether open or secret  sins and trespasses against truth or reason

towns had but believed and feared God We should indeed have opened out to them  all kinds of  blessings from heaven and earth  but they rejected  the truth  and We brought them to book for their misdeeds ","1050":"   Did the people of the towns feel secure against the coming of our wrath by night while they were asleep ","1051":"   Or else did they feel secure against its coming in broad

they could not hear ","1054":"   Such were the towns whose story We  thus  relate unto thee  there came indeed to them their apostles with clear  signs   but they would not believe what they had rejected before  Thus doth God seal up the heart of those who reject faith ","1055":"   Most of them We found not men  true  to their covenant  but most of them We found rebellious and disobedient

Pharaoh  I am an apostle from the Lord of the worlds ","1058":"    One for whom it is right to say nothing but truth about God  Now have I come unto you  people  from your Lord with a clear  sign   so

indeed a sorcerer well versed ","1063":"    His plan is to get you out of your land then what is it ye counsel  ","1064":"   They said   keep him and his brother in suspense  for a while   and send to the cities men to collect","1065":"   and bring up to thee all  our  sorcerers well versed  ","1066":"   So there came the sorcerers to Pharaoh  they said  Of course we shall have a  suitable  reward

first  throw  ","1069":"   Said Moses   Throw ye  first    So when they threw they bewitched the eyes of the people and struck terror into them  for they showed a great  feat of  magic ","1070":"   We put it into Moses s mind by inspiration   throw  now  thy rod   and behold  it swallows up straightway all the falsehoods which they fake ","1071":"   Thus truth was confirmed and all that they did was made of no effect ","1072":"   So the  great ones  were vanquished there and then and were made to look small ","1073":"   But the sorcerers fell down prostrate in adoration ","1074":"   Saying   we believe in the Lord of the worlds ","1075":"    The Lord of Moses and Aaron  ","1076":"   Said Pharaoh   believe ye in him before I give you permission  Surely this is a trick which ye have planned

cross  ","1078":"   They said   for us we are but sent back unto our Lord ","1079":"    But thou dost wreak thy vengeance on us simply because we believed in the signs of our Lord when they reached us

people to spread mischief in the land and to abandon thee and thy gods   He said   Their male children will we slay   only  their females will we save alive  and we have over them  power  irresistible  ","1081":"   Said Moses to his people   Pray for help from God and  wait  in patience and constancy  for the earth is God s to give as a heritage to such of his servants as He pleaseth  and the end is  best  for the righteous ","1082":"   They said   We have had  nothing but  trouble both before and after thou comest to us   He said   It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you inheritors in the earth  that so He may try you by your deeds     ","1083":"   We punished the people of Pharaoh with years  of drought  and shortness of crops  that they might receive admonition ","1084":"   But when good  times  came they said  this is due to us   when gripped by calamity they ascribed it to evil omens connected with Moses and those with him  Behold  in truth the omens of evil are theirs in God s sight but most of them do not understand ","1085":"   They said  to Moses    whatever be the signs thou bringest to work therewith the sorcery on us we shall never believe in thee  ","1086":"   So We sent  plagues  on them wholesale death Locusts Lice Frogs and Blood  signs openly Self explained  but they were steeped in arrogance a people given to sin ","1087":"   Every time the penalty fell on them they said   O Moses  on our behalf call on thy Lord in virtue of his promise to thee  if thou wilt remove the penalty from us we shall truly believe in thee and we shall send away the children of Israel with thee  ","1088":"   But every time We removed the penalty from them according to a fixed term which they had to fulfil Behold  they broke their word ","1089":"   So We exacted retribution from them  We drowned them in the sea because they rejected Our signs and failed to take warning from them ","1090":"   And We made a people considered weak  and of no account  inheritors of lands in both east and west lands whereon We sent down our blessings  The fair promise of the Lord was fulfilled for the children of Israel because they had patience and constancy and We levelled to the ground the great works and fine buildings which Pharaoh and his people erected  with such pride  ","1091":"   We took the children of Israel  with safety  across the sea  They came upon a people devoted entirely to some idols they had  They said   O Moses  fashion for us a god like unto the gods they have   He said   surely ye are a people without knowledge

God when it is God who hath endowed you with gifts above the nations  ","1094":"   And remember We rescued you from Pharaoh s people who afflicted you with the worst of penalties who slew your male children and saved alive your females  in that was a momentous trial from your Lord    ","1095":"   We appointed for Moses thirty nights and completed  the period  with ten  more   thus was completed the term  of communion  with his Lord forty nights  And Moses had charged his brother Aaron  before he went up    Act for me amongst my people  do right and follow not the way of those who do mischief  ","1096":"   When Moses came to the place appointed by Us and his Lord addressed him He said   O my Lord  show  Thyself  to me that I may look upon thee   God said   by no means canst thou see Me  direct   but look upon the mount  if it abide in its place then shalt thou see Me   When his Lord manifested his glory on the mount He made it as dust and Moses fell down in a swoon  When he recovered his senses he said   Glory be to Thee  to thee I turn in repentance and I am the first to believe    God  said   O Moses  I have chosen thee above  other  men by the mission I  have given thee  and the words I  have spoken to thee   take then the  revelation  which I give thee and be of those who give thanks  ","1097":"    God  said   O Moses  I have chosen thee Above  other  men By the mission

wicked  how they lie desolate   ","1099":"   Those who behave arrogantly on the earth in defiance of right them will I turn away from My signs they will not believe in them  and if they see the way of right conduct they will not adopt it as the way  but if they see the way of error that is the way they will adopt  for they rejected Our signs and failed to take warning from them ","1100":"   Those who reject Our signs and the meeting in the hereafter vain are their deeds  can they expect to be rewarded except as they have wrought    ","1101":"   The people of Moses made in his absence out of their ornaments the image of a calf  for worship   it seemed to low  did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor show them the way  They took it for worship and they did wrong ","1102":"   When they repented and saw that they had erred they said   If our Lord have not mercy upon us and forgive us we shall indeed be of those who perish  ","1103":"   When Moses came back to his people angry and grieved he said   evil it is that ye have done in my place in my absence  did ye make haste to bring on the judgment of your Lord   He put down the tablets seized his brother by  the hair of  his head and dragged him to him  Aaron said   son of my mother  the people did indeed reckon me as naught and went near to slaying me  make not the enemies rejoice over my misfortune nor count thou me amongst the people of sin  ","1104":"   Moses prayed   O my Lord  forgive me and my brother  admit us to Thy mercy  for Thou art the Most Merciful of those who sow mercy     ","1105":"   Those who took the calf  for worship  will indeed be overwhelmed with wrath from their Lord and with shame in this life  thus do We recompense those who invent  falsehoods  ","1106":"   But those who do wrong

guidance and mercy for such as fear their Lord ","1108":"   And Moses chose seventy of his people for Our place of meeting  when they were seized with violent quaking he prayed   O my Lord  if it had been Thy will Thou couldst have destroyed long before both them and me  wouldst Thou destroy us for the deeds of the foolish one among us  This is no more than Thy trial  by it Thou causest whom Thou
