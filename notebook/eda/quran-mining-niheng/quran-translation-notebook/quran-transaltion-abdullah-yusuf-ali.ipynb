Mīrzā Hairat of Delhi also published a translation, (Delhi 1919): the Commentary which he intended to publish in a separate volume of Introduction was, as far as I know, never published. My dear friend, the late Nawwāb ‘Imād-ul-Mulk Saiyid Husain Bilgrāmī of Hyderabad, Deccan, translated a portion, but he did not live to complete his work. The Ahmadīya Sect has also been active in the field. Its Qādiyān Anjuman published a version of the first Sīpāra in 1915. Apparently no more was published. Its Lahore Anjuman has published Maulvi Muhammad ‘Alī’s translation (first edition in 1917), which has passed through more than one edition. It is a scholarly work, and is equipped with adequate explanatory matter in the notes and the Preface, and a fairly full Index. But the English of the Text is decidedly weak, and is not likely to appeal to those who know no Arabic. There are two other Muslim translations of great merit. But they have been published without the Arabic Text. Hafiz Gulām Sarwar’s translation (published in 1930 or 1929) deserves to be better known than it is. He has provided fairly full summaries of the Sūras, section by section, but he has practically no notes to his Text. I think such notes are necessary for a full understanding of the Text. In many cases the Arabic words and phrases are so pregnant of meaning that a Translator would be in despair unless he were allowed to explain all that he understands by them. Mr. Marmaduke Pickthall’s translation was published in 1930. He is an English Muslim, a literary man of standing, and an Arabic scholar. But he has added very few notes to elucidate the Text. His rendering is “almost literal”: it can hardly be expected that it can give an adequate idea of a Book which (in his own words) can be described as “that inimitable symphony the very sounds of which move men to tears and ecstasy.” Perhaps the attempt to catch something of that symphony in another language is impossible. Greatly daring, I have made that attempt. We do not blame an artist who tries to catch in his picture something of the glorious light of a spring landscape.” <a href=\"/translations-of-the-quran/\">Continue reading the complete article: Translations of the Qur-ān</a></p></div></div></div><section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-343a791 elementor-section-content-middle elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-inner-section\" data-id=\"343a791\" data-element_type=\"section\"><div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\"><div class=\"elementor-row\"><div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-0bad058 elementor-column elementor-col-50 elementor-inner-column\" data-id=\"0bad058\" data-element_type=\"column\"><div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\"><div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\"><div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-41e91bc elementor-hidden-phone elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"41e91bc\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"image.default\"><div class=\"elementor-widget-container\"><div class=\"elementor-image\"> <img width=\"512\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://quranyusufali.com/wp-content/uploads/quran-yusuf-ali-logo.png\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"A.

       " '37. Then learnt Adam from his Lord words of inspiration and his Lord turned toward him; for He is Oft-Returning Most Merciful.',\n",

       " '50. And remember We divided the sea for you and saved you and drowned Pharaoh’s people within your very sight.',\n",
       " '51. And remember We appointed forty nights for Moses and in his absence you took the calf (for worship) and ye did grievous wrong.',\n",
       " '52. Even then We did forgive you; there was a chance for you to be grateful.',\n",
       " '53. And remember We gave Moses the Scripture and the criterion (between right and wrong) there was a chance for you to be guided aright.',\n",
       " '54. And remember Moses said to his people: “O my people! Ye have indeed wronged yourselves by your worship of the calf so turn (in repentance) to your Maker and slay yourselves (the wrong-doers); that will be better for you in the sight of your Maker.” Then He turned toward you (in forgiveness); for He is Oft-returning Most Merciful.',\n",
       " '55. And remember ye said: “O Moses! we shall never believe in thee until we see God manifestly” but ye were dazed with thunder and lightning even as ye looked on.',\n",
       " '56. Then We raised you up after your death; ye had the chance to be grateful.',\n",
       " '57. And We gave You the shade of clouds and sent down to you manna and quails saying: “Eat of the good things We have provided for you”; (but they rebelled); to Us they did no harm but they harmed their own souls.',\n",
       " '58. And remember We said: “Enter this town and eat of the plenty therein as ye wish; but enter the gate with humility in posture and in words and We shall forgive you your faults and increase (the portion of) those who do good.”',\n",
       " '59. But the transgressors changed the word from that which had been given them; so We sent on the transgressors a plague from heaven for that they infringed (our command) repeatedly.Section 7',\n",
       " '60. And remember Moses prayed for water for his people; We said: “Strike the rock with thy staff.” Then gushed forth therefrom twelve springs. Each group knew its own place for water. So eat and drink of the sustenance provided by God and do no evil nor mischief on the (face of the) earth.',\n",
       " '61. And remember ye said: “O Moses! we cannot endure one kind of food (always); so beseech thy Lord for us to produce for us of what the earth groweth its pot-herbs and cucumbers its garlic lentils and onions.” He said: “will ye exchange the better for the worse? Go ye down to any town and ye shall find what ye want!” They were covered with humiliation and misery; they drew on themselves the wrath of God. This because they went on rejecting the signs of God and slaying His messengers without just cause. This because They rebelled and went on transgressing.Section 8',\n",
       " '62. Those who believe (in the Qur’an) and those who follow the Jewish (Scriptures) and the Christians and the Sabians and who believe in God and the last day and work righteousness shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve.',\n",
       " '63. And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you (the towering height) of Mount (Sinai) (saying): “Hold firmly to what We have given you and bring (ever) to remembrance what is therein perchance ye may fear God.”',\n",
       " '64. But ye turned back thereafter had it not been for the Grace and Mercy of God to you ye had surely been among the lost.',\n",
       " '65. And well ye knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath; We said to them: “Be ye apes despised and rejected.”',\n",
       " '66. So We made it an example to their own time and to their posterity and a lesson to those who fear God.',\n",
       " '67. And remember Moses said to his people: “God commands that ye sacrifice a heifer.” They said: “Makest thou a laughing-stock of us?” He said: “God save me from being an ignorant (fool)!”',\n",
       " '68. They said: “Beseech on our behalf thy Lord to make plain to us what (heifer) it is! He said: “He says: The heifer should be neither too old nor too young but of middling age; now do what ye are commanded!.',\n",
       " '69. They said: “Beseech on our behalf thy Lord to make plain to us her color.” He said: ” He says a fawn-colored heifer pure and rich in tone the admiration of beholders!”',\n",

       " \"136. Out of what God hath produced in abundance in tilth and in cattle they assigned Him a share: they say according to their fancies: “This is for God and this for our `partners'”! But the share of their `partners’ reacheth not God whilst the share of God reacheth their `partners’! Evil (and unjust) is their assignment!.\",\n",
       " '137. Even so in the eyes of most of the Pagans their `partners’ made alluring the slaughter of their children in order to lead them to their own destruction and cause confusion in their religion. If God had willed they would not have done so: but leave alone them and their inventions.',\n",
       " '138. And they say that such and such cattle and crops are taboo and none should eat of them except those whom so they say We wish; further there are cattle forbidden to yoke or burden and cattle on which (at slaughter) the name of God is not pronounced; inventions against God’s name: soon will He requite them for their inventions.',\n",
       " '139. They say: “What is in the wombs of such and such cattle is specially reserved (for food) for our men and forbidden to our women; but if it is still-born then all have shares therein. For their (false) attribution (of superstitions to God): He will soon punish them: for He is full of Wisdom and Knowledge.',\n",

It is He who produceth gardens with trellises and without and dates and tilth with produce of all kinds and olives and pomegranates similar (in kind) and different (in variety): eat of their fruit in their season but render the dues that are proper on the day that the harvest is gathered. But waste not by excess: for God loveth not the wasters.',\n",
       " '142. Of the cattle are some for burden and some for meat. Eat what God hath provided for you and follow not the footsteps of Satan: for he is to you an avowed enemy.',\n",

       " '144. Of camels a pair and of oxen a pair; say hath He forbidden the two males or the two females or the (the young) which the wombs of the two females enclose? Were ye present when God ordered you such a thing? But who doth more wrong than one who invents a lie against God to lead astray men without knowledge? For God guideth not people who do wrong.Section 18',\n",
       " '145. Say: “I find not in the Message received by me by inspiration any (meat) forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it unless it be dead meat or blood poured forth or the flesh of swine for it is an abomination or what is impious (meat) on which a name has been invoked other than God’s.” But (even so) if a person is forced by necessity without wilful disobedience nor transgressing due limits thy Lord is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.',\n",
       " '146. For those who followed the Jewish Law We forbade every (animal) with undivided hoof and We forbade them the fat of the ox and the sheep except what adheres to their backs or their entrails or is mixed up with a bone: this in recompense for their wilful disobedience: for We are True (in Our ordinances).',\n",
       " '147. If they accuse thee of falsehood say: “Your Lord is full of Mercy All-embracing; but from people in guilt never will His wrath be turned back.',\n",
       " '148. Those who give partners to God will say “If God had wished we should not have given partners to Him nor would our father; nor should we have had any taboos.” So did their ancestors argue falsely until they tasted of Our wrath. Say: “Have ye any (certain) Knowledge? If so produce it before us. Ye follow nothing but conjecture: Ye do nothing but lie.”',\n",
       " '149. Say: “With God is the argument that reaches home: if it had been his will he could indeed have guided you all.”',\n",
       " '150. Say: “Bring forward your witnesses to prove that God did forbid so and so.” If they bring such witnesses be not thou amongst them: nor follow thou the vain desires of such as treat Our Signs as falsehoods and such as believe not in the Hereafter: for they hold others as equal with their Guardian-Lord.Section 19',\n",
       " '151. Say: “Come I will rehearse what God hath (really) prohibited you from”: join not anything as equal with Him; be good to your parents: kill not your children on a plea of want; We provide sustenance for you and for them; come not nigh to shameful deeds whether open or secret; take not life which God hath made sacred except by way of justice and law: thus doth He command you that ye may learn wisdom.',\n",

And come not nigh to the orphan’s property except to improve it until he attain the age of full strength; give measure and weight with (full) justice; no burden do We place on any soul but that which it can bear; whenever ye speak speak justly even if a near relative is concerned; and fulfil the Covenant of God: thus doth He command you that ye may remember.',\n",
       " '153. Verily this is My Way leading straight: follow it: follow not (other) paths: they will scatter you about from His (great) path: thus doth He command you that ye may be righteous.',\n",
       " '154. Moreover We gave Moses the Book completing (Our favor) to those who would do right and explaining all things in detail and a guide and a mercy that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord.Section 20',\n",
       " '155. And this is a Book which We have revealed as a blessing: so follow it and be righteous that ye may receive mercy:',\n",

       " '157. Or lest ye should say: “If the Book had only been sent down to us we should have followed its guidance better than they.” Now then hath come unto you a Clear (sign) from your Lord and a guide and a mercy: then who could do more wrong than one who rejecteth God’s signs and turneth away therefrom? In good time shall We requite those who turn away from Our Signs with a dreadful penalty for their turning away.',\n",

Say: “Wait ye: we too are waiting.”',\n",

       " '164. Say: “Shall I seek for (my) Cherisher other than God when He is the Cherisher of all things (that exist)?” Every soul draws the meed of its acts on none but itself: no bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another. Your goal in the end is toward God: He will tell you the truth of the things wherein ye disputed.',\n",

       " '20. Then began satan to whisper suggestions to them bringing openly before their minds all their shame that was hidden from them (before): he said “Your Lord only forbade you this tree lest ye should become angels or such beings as live for ever.”',\n",
       " '21. And he swore to them both that he was their sincere adviser.',\n",
       " '22. So by deceit he brought about their fall: when they tasted of the tree their shame became manifest to them and they began to sew together the leaves of the garden over their bodies. And their Lord called unto them: “Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you that satan was an avowed enemy unto you?”',\n",
       " '23. They said: “our Lord! we have wronged our own souls: if Thou forgive us not and bestow not upon us Thy mercy we shall certainly be lost.”',\n",

       " '27. O ye children of Adam! let not satan seduce you in the same manner as he got your parents out of the garden stripping them of their raiment to expose their shame: for he and his tribe watch you from a position where ye cannot see them: We made the evil ones friends (only) to those without faith.',\n",
       " '28. When they do aught that is shameful they say: “We found our fathers doing so”; and “God commanded us thus”: say: “Nay God never commands what is shameful: do ye say of God what ye know not?”',\n",
       " '29. Say: “My Lord hath commanded justice; and that ye set your whole selves (to him) at every time and place of prayer and call upon him making your devotion sincere as in his sight: such as he created you in the beginning so shall ye return.”',\n",
       " '30. Some He hath guided: others have (by their choice) deserved the loss of their way: in that they took the evil ones in preference to God for their friends and protectors and think that they receive guidance.',\n",
       " '31. O children of Adam! wear your beautiful apparel at every time and place of prayer: eat and drink: but waste not by excess for God loveth not the wasters.Section 4',\n",

Say: they are in the life of this world for those who believe (and) purely for them on the Day of Judgment. Thus do We explain the signs in detail for those who understand.',\n",
       " '33. Say: The things that my Lord hath indeed forbidden are: shameful deeds whether open or secret; sins and trespasses against truth or reason; assigning of partners to God for which he hath given no authority; and saying things about God of which ye have no knowledge.',\n",

For such their portion appointed must reach them from the Book (of decrees); until when Our messengers (of death) arrive and take their souls they say: “where are the things that ye used to invoke besides God?” They will reply “they have left us in the lurch” and they will bear witness against themselves that they had rejected God.',\n",
       " '38. He will say: “enter ye in the company of the peoples who passed away before you men and Jinns into the fire. Every time a new people enters it curses its sister-people (that went before) until they follow each other all into the fire.

       " '39. Then the first will say to the last: “see then! no advantage have ye over us; so taste ye of the penalty for all that ye did!”Section 5',\n",

       " '41. For them there is hell as a couch (below) and folds and folds of covering above: such is Our requital of those who do wrong.',\n",
       " '42. But those who believe and work righteousness no burden do We place on any soul but that which it can bear they will be companions of the garden therein to dwell (for ever).',\n",
       " '43. And We shall remove from their hearts any lurking sense of injury; beneath them will be rivers flowing; and they shall say: “Praise be to God Who hath guided us to this (felicity): never could we have found guidance had it not been for the guidance of God: indeed it was the truth that the apostles of our Lord brought unto us.” And they Shall hear the cry: “Behold! the garden before you! Ye have been made its inheritors for your deeds (of righteousness).”',\n",
       " '44. The companions of the garden will call out to the companions of the fire: “We have indeed found the promises of our Lord to us true: have you also found your Lord’s promises true?” They shall say “yes”; but a crier shall proclaim between them: “the curse of God is on the wrong- doers;',\n",
       " '45. “Those who would hinder (men) from the path of God and would seek in it something crooked: they were those who Denied the Hereafter.”',\n",
       " '46. Between them shall be a veil and on the heights will be men who would know everyone by his marks: they will call out to the companions of the garden “peace on you” they will not have entered but they will have an assurance (thereof.)',\n",
